# "Segmenting Transcriptomics in Spatial Neighborhoods"

## Objectives
1. To find the spatially variable genes on the tissue based on spatial autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I)
2. To take the spatially variable genes and study their hotspots and immediate neighborhood

## Package Dependencies
- Seurat
- spdeep
- KNN
- dplyr
- ggplot2
