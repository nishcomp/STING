\usage{
find_hotspots(
  seurat_object,
  gene_name,
  num_neighbors = 20,
  neighbor_fraction = 0.05,
  percentile = 0.8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seurat_object}{A Seurat object containing spatial transcriptomics data.}

\item{gene_name}{A character string specifying the gene to analyze for hotspot detection.}

\item{num_neighbors}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider when assessing local agreement. Default is \code{20}.}

\item{neighbor_fraction}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of neighboring spots that must also be hotspots for a spot to be classified as a hotspot. Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{percentile}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the percentile threshold for defining initial hotspots based on gene expression. Default is \code{0.8}.}
}
\value{
The modified Seurat object with an additional metadata column named \code{hotspot_<gene_name>} indicating whether each spot is classified as a "Hotspot" or "Non-hotspot".
}
\description{
Identifies spatial hotspots of gene expression in a Seurat object by classifying spots as hotspots or non-hotspots based on gene expression levels and local neighborhood agreement.
}
\details{
This function identifies gene expression hotspots by:
\itemize{
  \item Selecting initial hotspot spots where the gene expression is above the specified percentile threshold.
  \item Using k-nearest neighbors (\code{num_neighbors}) to assess whether a spot remains a hotspot based on its neighbors.
  \item Classifying each spot as either "Hotspot" or "Non-hotspot" based on local neighborhood agreement.
}
The classification results are stored in the Seurat object under a new metadata column named \code{hotspot_<gene_name>}.
