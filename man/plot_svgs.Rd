\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing at least the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{genes}: Gene names or identifiers.
  \item \code{I}: Moran's I statistic values for spatial autocorrelation.
  \item \code{category}: Categories or clusters to which genes belong.
}}

\item{title}{A character string specifying the title of the plot. Default is "Spatially Variable Genes".}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of plot to create. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"circular"}: A circular graph layout.
  \item \code{"linear"}: A linear graph layout.
}
Default is \code{"circular"}.}

\item{genes}{A column of gene names.}

\item{morans}{A column of Moran's I statistics.}

\item{category}{The category or grouping variable for the genes.}

\item{range}{Lower/upper ceilings for dot size. Default is (3,10)}

\item{output_file}{A character string specifying the path to save the plot as a file (e.g., "plot.png").
If \code{NULL} (the default), the plot is not saved to a file.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object visualizing the spatially variable genes in the chosen graph layout.
}
\description{
Visualizes spatially variable genes (SVGs) as either a circular or linear graph, showing the relationships between genes,
their Moran's I values, and their categories.
}
\details{
This function creates a graph layout where:
\itemize{
  \item Nodes represent genes, with sizes corresponding to Moran's I values.
  \item Nodes are colored based on their categories.
}
Labels are adjusted to prevent overlap and ensure readability.

For the circular layout:
\itemize{
  \item Nodes are arranged in a circular pattern.
  \item Labels are placed around the circumference of the circle.
  \item Node sizes represent Moran's I values, and colors correspond to gene categories.
}

For the linear layout:
\itemize{
  \item Nodes are arranged along the x-axis according to their category and Moran's I values.
  \item Labels are placed along the graph, with adjustments to prevent overlap.
  \item Node sizes represent Moran's I values, and colors correspond to gene categories.
}
